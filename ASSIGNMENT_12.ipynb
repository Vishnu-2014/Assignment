The sad thing is that we are not quite there in the Real \\nWorld. This is because our solar system is so \\nvast, and our rockets can™t produce quite \\n\\nenough speed to make journeys short. NASA has been working on this \\nproblem for over 50 years and has come up \\nwith many possible solutions. Each one is \\nmore expensive than just using ordinary fuels and engines like the ones used on most \\n\\nrockets! Problem 1 Œ The entire International Space Stati\\non orbits Earth at a speed of 28,000 kilometers per hour (17,000 mph). At this speed, how many days would it take to travel to the sun from Earth, located at a distance of 149 million kilometers? \\nProblem 2 Œ The planet Neptune is located 4.5 billion kilometers from Earth. How many years would it take a rocket trave\\nling at the speed of the International Space \\nStation to make this journey? Problem 3 Œ The fastest unmanned spacecraft, Helios-2, traveled at a speed of \\n253,000 km/hr. In the table below, use proportional\\n math to fill in the travel times from \\nthe sun to each planet traveling at the speed of Helios-2. Give your answers to the nearest tenth in appropriate units of days or years.
